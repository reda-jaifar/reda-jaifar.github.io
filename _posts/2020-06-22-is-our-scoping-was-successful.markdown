A new project is in the pipeline and we are ready to kick off this new challenge, Our team is ready and full of
 energy and enthusiasm. A scoping sessions are scheduled this week.
 
A first session stared with a short description of the project, making the focus on the business and strategic impact
 and how will help the company to accelerate its digital transformation in the perspective of developing new digital
  products and cloud based offerings. It's time to finish the workshop with one conclusion all team members share the
   same frustration regarding where we want to go.
   
During the week these sessions succeeded  one after the other and still having a blur vision, confused features and
 also an organization that we believe is not convenient to drive the boat to the shore.
 
# What were the key points that might cause this blocking situation?

## Exploring the real value
As a product owner I have to gather the maximum information about the customer business, their strategic goals and
 where they want to land once the project take off. I remember this quote from Dassault Systemes [Dassault Systemes

    If ask the right questions, we can change the world
    
asking a pertinent questions is crucial to understand the business and the desired value we expect to provide.
For a successful scoping workshop, this job should be prepared before and these reflexions and analysis at least
 started in order to keep the team members away from any frustration or defeatism. 
 
## Why The role of Product Owner is very important at this stage?
The product owner is the guard of the vision and customer value, keeping the train on the track requires a lot of
 efforts regarding the business understanding and mapping this knowledge to user stories that designers, developers
  are easily able to take in charge and implement.
  
Based on our experience, our product owner iterated regularly over the backlog to refine the items and get rid of the
 irrelevant ones, each time he was approached to revise a business rule.
 
## Specifications and requirements
What kind of format our documents should follow to write down the specifications and requirements and how much
 details we should draft? this question is indispensable to answer before starting, the more we give attention to
  what to write the more implementation will be easily taking into consideration all constraints and customer
   specific requirements such as solution's time responding, availability, number of future users. These notes help
    considerably when it come to architecture design and technical stack decisions.
    
## Deliverable frequency and type
While in agile project continuous delivery is at the heart of it and shouldn't be part of discussions but the
 frequency of delivery and type of deliverable could be, The reason why team should agree and state early these
  points.
The adoption of the continuous improvement is totally appreciated while the business is evolving but we have to pay
 attention before investing in this area cause often lead to delivery postponed even contract issues.
 
## Cost
Sometimes and due to technical choices such a licences, do not forget to include them in your budget estimation and
 let stakeholders know about them, When it comes to money transparency is the key to spread trust and avoid
  undesirable surprises. the rules are:

* calculate an accurate budget and make sure all elements are included.
* define a process that help to keep the budget flexible regarding feature without over budgeting.

## Communication
Whatever the project scope or size, communication is a key to a successful customer value and team satisfaction
, Defining communication channels, rules and tools between stakeholders and project team can considerably impact
 project progression and target achieving. Communication also implies some values such as transparency about team's
  capabilities what we can and we cannot do, these kind of statements should be communicated as soon as possible to
   help the customer take the best decision.
In my point of view, I prefer to avoid the usage of multiple communication tools and format with our stakeholders
 (telephone, email, video-conference, meetings...), this can help keep our exchanges simple, effective.
 
Regarding internal communication between team members, Personally I have a lot of appreciation  for meetings or face
 to face discussion believing that is the quick and right way to argument a decision or explain a point of view to
  convince my team-mates of any technical choice. Otherwise using project management tool to track and monitor still
   very useful in order to keep everyone updated and everything documented.
   
### Flexibility and adaptation
Agile practices come to solves today's project issues and pains, but at any stage we should be wedged, In my opinion
 we have to cope with challenges, involve team in every decision, think differently and act like one.
 Scoping is the stage where we invite all involved people to the same boat with one goal is to reach the
  destination.
