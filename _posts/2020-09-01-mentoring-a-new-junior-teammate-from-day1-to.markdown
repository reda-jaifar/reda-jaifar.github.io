# Teaching in my mind 
I always love my parents' job, I grew up in a family of two teachers, later my dad became a school principal. They were
sharing every day their experiences, funny situations with students, and emotions. In addition to all this
 information about teaching, I retain one thing that I feel it
 > Teaching others is such a satisfying feeling, especially if you can observe their progression along the time

these concepts were carved in my subconscious mind since then. I remember in mid-high school I went to ask about a
 course in a private school, After introducing my self the principal proposed to me teaching Adobe Photoshop and web
  concepts, Without diving into the details of this journey, I do appreciate it.
  
Time passes and I find myself several times in the shoes of a teacher, the story I share in the next paragraph is
 quite different from teaching, but has many similarities I wanted to write down.
 
# Mentoring someone, who decided?
In a company, this approach may be part of its culture, So the HR team once they hire a new joiner, they ask a
 senior who wants to play the role of mentor, certainly this is a voluntary decision and not a hierarchical one, as mentoring requires first of all the initiative and passion to do it.
  This is not a work task to complete, this is a
   mindset to share with love.
   
Regardless of having this culture or not, in many cases, a spontaneous relationship between a senior and a new team
-member took place, mainly due to their personalities rapprochement. Then we begin to talk about mentoring as the
 senior introduces his new team-mate to other teams, lets him discover departments, work methods, and any knowledge
  that may help him be  well integrated.
  
# What should we have to succeed a mentoring program?
In my opinion, we need to behave like coach  and trainee, or like teacher and student. As a mentor, Having this
 passion of knowledge sharing, feeling so satisfied while seeing others growing up, Being generous when it comes to
  advising and guiding are all a must have values we believe in. Regarding skills, we need to be good in
   communication, capacity of thought, and patience.
  
  In the other side, the trainee needs some skills, or call them behaviours like be good
   listener, a hungry man who wants to enrich his knowledge by asking for details, but certainly without disturbing
    the mentor, Because this one is meanwhile a employee with tasks and missions to complete, So as a trainee we keep
     calm and patient when we don't have some information or answers immediately. For the trainee the mentoring
      should represents an opportunity to know more, have different points of view, but in any case should impact
       our analysis capabilities, and influence our decision making, we have to protect our autonomous which it is
        the most valuable goal we target.
