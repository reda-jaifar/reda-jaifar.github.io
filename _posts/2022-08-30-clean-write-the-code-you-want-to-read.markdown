## Clean Code!
### Why should I care?
We, software engineers almost spent more time reading code than writing new lines, how many times we complain about someone else's. Code can obviously give us an idea about
the quality of code and how much the writer cares about. If you dislike reading bad code, you already made your first step toward writing good code if you really care about
your heritage.
There are many good reasons to care about writing clean code, adding the artistic layer to your code is an inspiring reason for me to learn and apply the clean code rules and principles.

### What clean code brings to me?
Clean code is what make us a professional programmer, someone with high level ethics who care about the present and the future of his code, he believes that lines of code
can live for long and can be enhanced by others with ease and passion. Like a book author what makes him happy is how readers enjoying turning the pages of his book one after the other without realizing the time elapsed.

### Clean code is about philosophy!
Obviously, clean code make us more than programmer, it helps us develop a good vision of the software we are building, caring about his growth,evolutionary and enhancement. Clean code make us a thinker about
maintainability, design, and the ability of the software to cope with changes quickly and easily.
Code is written to live but also to change and evolve.

### We are authors
Yes, we programmers are authors, that said, we have readers, Indeed we are responsible for communicating well with readers. The next time we write a line of code, we'll remember
we are author, writing for readers who will judge our effort.
