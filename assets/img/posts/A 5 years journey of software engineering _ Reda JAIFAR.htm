<p>Just another story of a software developer that has been started 5 years ago officially by getting my first job within the 3D Modeling Software leader provider worldwide as a junior software developer with a lot of passion and energy to write lines of code and make an impact but for sure at this stage, I can’t see it because it wasn’t about creating my mobile application that millions of people around the world are using or my web application with many active users a day, but a few years later it is and the product I worked on is making a great success and despite my modest contribution I do proud of this work no matter I left the company looking forward new challenges in a completely different sector.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was working with a group of friends on a platform, dreaming of reinventing the food making and delivery, we started developing “otchi” a web and mobile application for sharing meals and creating recipes but 7 months later we give on the project up and decided to stop investing our free time on this wonderful project, I confess this failure was very disappointing but I told my self “Hey! how can you ignore all the stuff you learned, it’s just another try why not to repeat”. late 2017 I joined a medical equipment manufacturer to develop software that runs on these different machines from Scanners to MRI and you can imagine that excitation I’m experiencing to start such mission with this sentence in my head</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>I’m going to develop software that runs on medical equipment helping in saving lives and bring smiles to those who
 are suffering from some diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this experience, I learned a lot about software development, first time to use the agile methods “SCRUM”, go on production quickly and communicating with users directly, their feedbacks and comments were useful, I realized that a software developer should never be like staying at the corner of your open space implementing user stories, and whether you are developer, tester or product owner this human interaction is mandatory to well understand the needs and bring the right added value instead of delivering features.</p>

<p>Yes! I’m leaving this job, this company, this role, I’m leaving my manager because even within the best technical environment a developer can work in and enjoy his collaboration we cannot avoid the conflicts when it reaches a closed door. This time the lesson is simple as “human first and I’m leaving for the interest of everybody not to run away from the confrontation”</p>

<p>I do appreciate all the conflict discussions I’ve had with my manager because we debated <strong>ideas</strong> and visions, not
 personas and behaviors.</p>

<p>Hopefully, a few months ago from writing these lines, I landed in the right place I was always looking for, Here we believe that culture and values are very important and working with people with who share the same insights and attitudes is not just titles that we put on company’s website but that is part of everybody’s mindset.</p>

<p>Here at my current job, we develop MVPs and squads are completely autonomous for their stack and architecture choices meanwhile we all teams within this happy community are using agile methods convinced that these methods not only increases productivity but also facilitates project management, improves the quality of work and makes flexible change possible.</p>

<p>It was about sharing my career path until now in a short story, I do like called journey with the faith that our job
 is part of our overall life, not an only professional one, this is why I’ll always trying to do it with <strong>passion</strong>
 , and surrounded with analogous and complementary <strong>people</strong>.</p>

<p>#learning is a never-ending story</p>
